The following points are worth noting:

  + Tests are provided for interface to backend web services.

  + Validation for login and registration uses a common data-driven
    approach.

  + Does length + digit check on password field for login form; not
    required as per specs.

  + Bad password for login displays backend error message; not entirely
    appropriate.
