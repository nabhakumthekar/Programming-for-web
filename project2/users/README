Note that the provided data object USER is put into the db as { _id:
ID, _data: USER }, where ID is the ID specified in the URL.  So the
USER object can contain anything including another _id field; it need
not even contain ID.

To automatically initialize db with model/users_data.json on start of
server uncomment users.initUsers() line in index.js.
